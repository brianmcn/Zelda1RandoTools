REMINDERS

Z-Tracker targets .Net Framework 4.8.  That's because Framework 4.x is part of the Windows OS, and so that makes Z-Tracker a small .zip file.
I could target .NET 6.0 in the future, but it would require users to have the .NET runtime installed as a pre-req (or else 'Publish' the app 
as self-contained, making the .zip file I give people hundreds of megs, which does not make sense as a strategy for adoption).

I should be able to upgrade to VS2022 and keep targetting as I am today.

since 1.3.0B...

since 1.3.0C...

       - MonsterDetail.Digdogger: do blocker(Recorder) logic
       - MonsterDetail.Dodongo: do blocker(Bomb) logic
       where Blocker(X) logic means: if there is already an X blocker, do nothing, else if there is a Maybe-X blocker, promote it to an X, else if there is an empty blocker box, fill it with Maybe-X
since 1.3.0D...
 - all error beeps now come with a Reminder Log, so you can see exactly what Z-Tracker was unhappy about

 - fix Hide Timer option not being respected at startup
since 1.3.1 release...

potion letter displays underneath coords, move Z/C back to the right a tiny bit, ensure nothing else display overlaps with like mixed HDN or anything

gob: timer stops updating for 2s when clicking triforce
 - is only calling doUIUpdate once, when I test by loading a completed seed, but maybe is very expensive all the listeners? find way to measure...
 - did not repro in fresh tracker instance for gob... maybe i am hooking/leaking listeners throughout gameplay somehow?

mixed 1st & 2nd use same map, though my map is wrong, see https://discord.com/channels/368763663986982912/586261700064575488/1060005367238639776 notably 1q3 should be green in 2qmix

gob: wishes popout windows could scale (maybe non-UI but in json?)



fun stuff - mark heart, play 'yum' sound? hook own sound effects? (similar to custom reminders)

maybe 'tip' about number of transport stairs per shapes dungeon ( = K + #visibleSegments where K = 000011116 )

More contextual popout ideas:
 - imagine a window that is 'rooms that dont drop' that updates based on dungeon you are in
 - or vanilla drop rooms if you have 1Q/2Q maps selected
 - map puzzle-piecing - just show the player-marked room map outlines of 1-6 or 7-9, and let the player 'do it in their head'





SpecialK: wants yellow% https://discord.com/channels/368763663986982912/920498784142774332/1137693935435784234


fun side project: no enemies: https://discord.com/channels/368763663986982912/576879458552643594/1137607507192332368



panulphe:
 - sent seed to count potion shops (maybe get rid of hard bound for pot/DR/MMG/TAH/hint? would need to adjust spot summary)
    - if you do mismark, when you get to e.g. the 8th of 7 potion shops, it's like, ok, maybe I mismarked the 3rd one, but I'm standing here now 
        in front of the 8th and it'd be nice to mark it but you wont let me... 


press ctrl or something does eyeball show-map toggle thingy?  or experiment with it like 'blinking away' all the tiles every 2s or something
 - i tried both of these and didn't love either... still looking for a way for me not to confuse e.g. 1Q3 and river cave when walking to them and obscured by icons


mouseover OW tile, maybe there's a statusbar that says coords, what the mark is (in case hidden), etc?



BT: display how many bomb spots left in this region


consider cheap and expensive keys and meats as separate marks? 


lots of new icons that could appear in Draw menu



new armos reminder: 5 mins after you have marked at least 3 armos spots, if the armos item box is still empty, remind once

possible new reminder category - item obtained in first 5 mins, remind 7 mins later? bow, silvers, akey, ladder
 - "dont forget you got an early X"
 - could trigger early if get arrow/silver after bow, or bow after arrow... or maybe 'now that you have a bow an arrow' maybe just have an auto-reminder for that combo? hm
     - can hook into ""if not priorBowArrow"" logic
 - if mark any moat room, with ladder, one-time extra ladder reminder? (one-time for e.g. routing scenario, where may mark moats with ladder)
 - if recorder-to-unbeaten is on, reminder about it when you first get recorder
 - could have a whole sub-pop-up menu of extra reminders and individual categories
 - possibly a reminder when all dungeons have been found _or_hinted_, so you don't look everywhere when you have a hint? hm
 - possible reminder: 'there is only 1 remaining location that XXX can be, hover its hint-halo to see it'
 - possible reminder: if bow/silvers/ladder are marked red on tracker for more than N minutes, remind they exist in tracker box XXX
 - possible reminder: mark some dungeon N, get atlas book outside dungeon, return to dungeon tab N, remind 'you have a new map'?
Related: possible easteregg/configurable random speech, like motivationals or something? (kibitz.txt) would need option to turn it off, when you want to get serious


UCC may need testing of popup menus (since DoModalCore now throws if not popupIsActive)


feature to paint your map of 7/8 as a 'vanilla map outline' onto 8/7, with user-chosen offset? that is, entirely manual process?
 - or BeefSupremeTV, just an option to see 8 while in 7, or vice versa (like summary hover, shows over Notes maybe)
 (see also idea as popout window of maps)



some kind of on-map better viz of the dungeons, e.g. you're standing next to 3 yellow numerals, but what are blockers? which still has items? gotta look all over
 - could be nice to project a monster there maybe too, maybe select something to project, ... ? the monster on the lobby could take priority!
 - there really isn't room to display everything; a single 16x16 icon is about right to put off to the side, but is monster, or remain items, or blocker most important?
 - maybe could be a mouse-hover, like hover the dungeon and it pops up the full detail?  or something puts the details of all dungeons on map near them?
 - basically, there is a ton of info player need to consider to decide stuff, and not easy to find way to group it all in small field of view...


if e.g. hover recorder, and all recorderable spots are marked, no feedback ('None found' reuse? it's more like 'none left', hm)
 - or maybe subscript on item progress of how many each left? not obvious what means, though, and also no way to see remain bomb spot count


consider moving the tooltips in-window so they can get video captured, as their absence does make e.g. explainer videos more challenging
- could also have some tooltips with icons etc


routing lines are hard to see on light areas (lack of contrast), would be nice to give them dark framing (thicker black transparent line behind it), 
but also they are expensive garbage so would need to cache them all probably... i experimented a little, and really would need some advanced shaders i think



Broadcast option: always focus overworld ? bighead scenario - see what he thinks of 'square' window




in quick-start docs, maybe prioritize what people should track, so noobs can bite off smaller piece (maybe intersperse 'if you are new to z1r' advice in red/indent-italic text throughout, or something)
 - overworld: click 'dont care' all done things, except mark things to come back to: dungeons, any roads, white/magical sword caves, possibly some shops
 - dungeon items: tri & items as you get them, to know when dungeon is 'done'
 - dungeon maps: can do nothing... marking all stairs in 9... could mark blocker room in prior dungeon, and blocker type in blockers... eventually all of 9...
 - dungeon rooms: default maybe-pushblock room complete/uncomplete (maybe ? and X mapping from zhelper) is most common, after that transports, only occasionally other marks
 - key hook is "every time you leave something you'll come back to later, leave self some reminder", and leaving an incomplete dungeon is the commonest/most crucial one









mouse thumb button mapping? (again, macros)


more hotkeys: reset timer?  only if can place start spot with arrows (DONE), else need hand on mouse already anyway
macros? e.g. one hotkey means press these keys in sequence (could be zelda room to mark 3 no-doors, or tri room to mark room and tri drop)
 - note that zelda-room would 'play' 3-no-doors keys, if you already marked one side as a red wall, then it would cycle that door down 2 more to purple, hm.
        a consequence of door marks being non-idempotent. another reason 'cycle' keys can be problematic. if there was a 'mark left door unmarked' key, could work around it
 - stevie-o also made a thingy so you can have a hotkey mean one of each part of room/monsters/drop and one hotkey can mark all 3, similar idea
 - stevie-o also did a thing where 1 hotkey can cycle thru like N selections in various contexts (which I didn't like because e.g. secrets toggle bright)
 - conditional hotkeys? your 'Z' room hotkey in dungeons could behave differently in 1-8 versus 9 I guess that's kinda of what contexts are already, 
        it's like sub-context for dungeons.  but more conditional logic context (if current value is this then...) makes it possible to author 'cycle' logic

homer suggests: hotkey for mark-a-set-of-no-bomb-wall (for e.g. zelda room, or coming out into a single-room segment in the middle of 9)
 - actually, a hotkey that is 'mark all unmarked adjacent doors to this room as umbombable' has good value




Way to export&import labeled circled on overworld, for e.g. 1Q/2Q dungeons, shops, 100-secrets, etc... like save&load, but just a subset - generalize? (vanilla drops e.g. banana in 1)
 - would these overwrite user data? or live in a different layer? i'm thinking overwrite-if-no-data-there

beware, many buttons are Focusable, which can alter how hotkeys get routed

vincent bug: if you GRAB and drag a stair-pair room off the map, it's 'lost' and you can't mark 



also, doc all OptionsMenu
probably more description/screenshot of options menu, say initial defaults tailored to new folks
maybe also have an advanced/clean set of options, like I did for GM, hm




(separate)
consider 'dungeon time' computer, based on: download VOD, use ffmpeg to grab thumbnail even N seconds, trim to race boundary, have human choose where in image the '8' in LEVEL-8 is, 
    extract all those regions, average them all to cleanly get the crisp contour, and then best-match to 123456789?_, then graph time in dungeons
possibly consider broadcast-for-speedgaming if can link two of them




put some kind of screenshot on the TOC page, so it can be a first landing page like the master frontpage
maybe slightly more in quickstart guide? or somewhere a pic of overworld popup?




z1m1: fact that 'triforce' can be some other item is hard to track (I was drawing icons over tris in top-tracker)
 - If you get a triforce in a basement, draw a triforce-triangle over that item box where you found it (and mark the numbered triforce gotten in 'extra items')
 - Whatever the triforce item is, draw its icon in the empty space above the triforce
 - then a dungeon is 'complete' when the spot above the triforce, and all the item boxes, are filled (e.g. you got the Q/E/U items out of 5, only Ms can remain)
z1m1 note: there are 4 'free stuff' old men, that are letter/sword1/sword2/sword3.  you can't always distinguish, so mark next free one if you pick it up, or s2/s3 if cant (may need to swap)
z1m1 note: when take-any has non-hyrule equipment i take, just mark 'take potion' to check off the cave and not update another equipment
z1m1: I dont have a way to mark hyrule portals or extra doors within-Zebes (out of scope)
TODO doc the UserCustomChecklist stuff
TODO consider adding z1 complete, m1 complete to UCC, so can timeline either finish first



possibly a 'blank quest' alongside 1st/2nd/mixed for randomized overworlds, just 16x8 of blank tiles you can mark all of (DONE-ish)
 - TODO maybe remove choicedomain limits, e.g. TrackerModel's overworldTiles(isFirstQuestOverworld) code
TODO documentation of '...' options from startup screen and brief docs about DrawingLayer




speech: "tracker where is bomb shop" or "tracker where is level five" ? "link route to XXX" ? (non-marking queries have less reliability issues)
 - make an icon next to MHE which is speech explainer which is basically all the same targets with voice
 - also be able to change tab via voice? toggle show-gettables? (hotkey show gettables?)

"link show me"   <---- seems like best option maybe
 - "sword" {1/2/3}
 - "level" {1-9, or A-H or 9}
 - {arrow, blue ring, boomstick, bomb, candle, potion(or takeany), meat/bait, key, shield} shop
 - "arm owes", "open caves", "dungeons"
need to factor RouteIntention apart from RouteDestination
type RouteIntention =
    | SHOP of int            // shop types or potion   -- should also refactor into set of known map locations dest
    | LEVEL_INDEX of int     // -> OW_MAP or HINT_ZONE or none
    | SWORD of int           // -> OW_MAP or HINT_ZONE or none
    | ARMOS
    | OPEN CAVES
need like a failure icon to appear next to link for e.g. hover ring but no ring shop, or speak it

or how about a single hotkey that will
 - warp mouse to center 'choose a route dest' popup, with all the choices (except overworld tiles, which it partially obscures and does not offer alternative)
 - warp back after selection
and maybe double-clicking Link also does that hotkey-like popup.
The list of choices is
 - shops (incl. potions)
 - dungeons (known or hinted)
 - sword caves (known or hinted)
 - open caves
 - (not map tiles)



August40th: I've been playing with minor drops shuffled & there's no good way to mark minor items fron Armos, coast, or WS cave. 
 - just doc a strategy (white-click basements at start, Notes dungeons 'all done')



===========================================================================
distributing version process
 - for a full release, change the version number in OverworldData.fs (e.g. v1.0.0)
 - edit README.txt to point to upcoming branch URL
 - commit to master
 - make a branch e.g. "v1.0" in git which is a spur for the release (and bugfix updates to app/docs)
 - make a tag on the branch with the full version number e.g. "v1.0.0"
 - commit the branch
ALSO
 - put a zip in UserCustomAssets per the docs at install.md
 - update install.md direct link to discord message
ABOVE IS DONE
 - delete entire Relase directory
     - get rid of hotkeys/settings/crash log
 - run the program once
     - creates hotkeys/settings/crash log/ZTracker.lnk
 - delete Magnifier/Overworld/ExtraIcons directory, if started an overworld session
 - delete ZTracker.lnk (has my machine's paths hardcoded)
 - delete the .pdb file, it is huge
 - If used program, then maybe also do these:
     - delete LT numbers from settings (my screen window position)
     - delete ShowRunCustom.txt
 - zip up directory
 - publish Release in the branch on the tag, and add the zip as a resource
then users can
 - unzip folder somewhere
 - run Z1R_WPF.exe
 - that will start the program. it will also create a ZTracker.lnk shortcut in the folder, which you can copy wherever you like (e.g. place on desktop)

SMALL

link probably doesn't route to rupees, might be easy to add

voice feedback saying what mark, so less need to watch what you clicked?


ad-hoc counters? e.g. for whatever folks may want to track? hotkey'd?

> optional boxes or places to note consecutive/global

thinking about this again (especially now that I know how global works, and how to use it)
I was kinda imagining a "+1 hotkey" would be the easiest interaction, but +1/-1 buttons near the counter could also work, or even a way to 'set' the current one by clicking on a row of 0-9 buttons

still hard for me to imagine anyone tracking consecutive kills in a way other than counting aloud (edited)
[1:20 PM] homerjsmash: for me i wouldn't increment it with each kill, more like i'm building a count on death mountain and then i have three screens of boulders and peahats, ok good enemies I can kill again.. was i on 5 or 6? lol
[1:27 PM] Lorgon111: I see, oh interesting, ok

(from bogie's discord)
I presume you mean e.g. https://www.orderoftheate.com/zelda-1-randomizer/general-tips/drop-table and highlighting the current (next) row?
Would you map keyboard keys or controller buttons?  Is '+1' the only one you'd map?
Does the global do anything funky on a 16-fairy? (If so I guess players just manually reset it?)
I've been asked about this for Z-Tracker as well, but have only very recently learned how globals work to even think of implementing it.
[12:54 PM] Lorgon111: Was thinking it might make sense to just make a standalone app for this, with a few display options like:
 - show enemy groups (or not)
 - show all drop columns (or just the bomb-droppers one)
 - just show the counter 0-9 (and nothing else)
 - always on top (yes/no) (in case you want to place it over the edge of some other window)


homer: wants middle click in cyan and pink varieties, not just yellow, in dungeons too? (existing mark-shape, 2-corner-ellipse, is sufficient
 - try to be consistent with overworld? hm.... shift-right-click is already used for floordrop... i guess no-mouse means can't circle dungeon rooms today? hm
 - there is no good UI scheme for dungeons, rooms are already too overloaded.  if i ever make hotkeys substituable for mouse clicks, then could map it


clyceer: wants to drag in grab mode, rather than click-click



clicking the kitty should meow or purr or something



my modal elements violate MouseEnter/MouseLeave parity, so e.g.,
 - mouse into dungeon 3 map, L3 is showLocator highlighted on overworld
 - invoke room popup
 - move mouse into overworld map, click to dismiss popup
 - L3 is still showLocator()ed because dungeon map never got a MouseLeave event
I could not worry about that, or apply some ad-hoc fixes for the common case, but in general it seems non-trivial


consider controller-button push-to-talk to explicitly activate speech recognition, to compensate for streaming-speech accuracy
 - option to play a sound when voice makes a mark
 - maybe want a quick 'unmark' gesture, to undo accidents?
 - if ship PTT feature, need a gamepad button chooser binding thingy, even if e.g. ask them to go to gamepad-tester.com and then select a number 0-9
     - and probably also want keyboard bind like left shift, if can figure out

Speech recogn – can multiple be running at once? Different grammars, context based on mouse location/popups etc
select item box via voice?  select dungeon room via voice?

broadcast window doesnt capture drag-drop mouse movement

if HUDs were legal, visual-reminder-HUD would be nice

MEDIUM

possibly an 'any road' single hotkey that works like voice, and auto-selects next road? same for HDN for 'next dungeon'
 - Stevie-O hacked this with a new overworldTiles() state NextAnyRoad or whatever
 - there's AnyRoad and HDN dungeon, where a single hotkey for 'next' is nice
 - and then there's related idea of single hotkey to cycle thru many choices, e.g. C for chute (|| -> = -> none -> ||), 
       secrets (medium -> large -> small -> none -> medium, or whatever), etc, and user-configability
       but the issue is already existing mechanics there (e.g. 'S', 'S' toggles secret brightness, so conflict with cycling secret size)



If I want to put chosen color on backgrounds with text foreground (e.g. LEVEL-A) then see e.g.

regarding overworld magnifier:
jkoper: An interesting application of this zoomed grid, Lorgon, might be if you're playing with shuffle secret spots on and you can mark off spots you tried bombing or burning.



"seed replay", if log overworld marks, could 'replay' a 1 min summary of seed in tracker, might be fun.
 - or the simple implementation is 1 screenshot every minute, saved to a folder, then stitch together into video
     - each screeshot is like 150k, so 120 of those (2 hours) is 18M of disk space
     - people recording/streaming already have it implicitly



check for memory leaks
startup performance
https://github.com/microsoft/perfview
-OR- turn off tail calls IN BOTH PROJECTS and use VS profiler
prior work showed that 'routing' (computing accessible, drawing paths) is a big one; wonder if some kind of cache would be faster, but is a lot of work
PERF:
- scenario focused, e.g. right click overworld tile response speed (WPF is hard to measure)
- DONE: WPFUI:activatePopup(), maybe cache images and Canvases
- CustomComboBoxes:doModalGridSelect(), DONE: cache MakePrettyDashes? TODO: could rewrite a bit to cache borders etc
- https://kynosarges.org/WpfPerformance.html turn off anti-aliasing, DONE: freeze all immutable brushes and transforms
- DONE: hideLocator() is probably getting called due to implicit MouseLeave() when popup draws atop map, i should definitely exclude some work while the popup is active
- DONE: mapStateSummary.OwGettableLocations is a list of coords, should be array of bools, so Contains() calls can just be array lookup
- DONE: ensureRespecting...() when not drawing route marks should just iterate over the map tiles rather than doing the whole BFS each time
- WPFUI: let rect = ... for mouse highlight OW could reuse rect better
- DONE: cache some other Images and hotkey strings for perf based on profiling
- testing on my surface is useful
- for best performance on very low-end machines, use Tall window layout (Square draws about twice as much stuff) and turn off both "Draw Routes" and "Highlight Nearby" (most expensive stuff)





BIG

'undo'
if i had two auto saves (most recent, slightly older), then 'undo' could effectively be done by quitting and reloading an auto-save, if you oops...




ESOTERIC


always a candle shop blocked by at most bombs
always an arrow shop blocked by at most candle


stabbing an NPC in a dungeon increments the consecutive kill counter, but not the global


'step over the water'
It means a path exists where you have to walk across the water, which might mean the dungeon is at one of the river spots by the waterfall (but not in RR flags, since 
those river spots are 2Q overworld only) or that you you can cross a moat in a dungeon to get to the item.  But there might a different path through the dungeon where 
you do not need to cross the moat.  

fred: The gist is:  if you walk in with the bare minimum stuff (sword, bombs if I recall), you can't get to the room.  If you walk in with the bare minimum plus ladder, you can get to the room.
That doesn't guarantee that's the ONLY way to get there.  Sometimes, one path is blocked by ladder, and another blocked by recorder, for instance.  Then you could get 
both hints, but may find you don't need a ladder to get there.




The game (vanilla Z1) has 8 possible room states that can be set for the rooms (unless at some point I decide to do custom assembly):   KILL->DROP KILL->SHUTTER PUSH->STAIR PUSH->SHUTTER   STAND
0 - Nothing happens.  Drop stands in the room, doors stay shut on room clear.                                                               .          .             .           .             X
1 - Drop stands in the room, shutters open on room clear.                                                                                   .          X             .           .             X
2 - "Master" enemy room.  Killing the enemy in slot 0 kills all enemies in the room.  Shutter doors do not open.                            .          .             .           .             .
3 - No drop, doors only open if you hold the Triforce of Power.                                                                             .          .             .           .             .
4 - Drop standing if present, push a block to open shutter doors when all cleared.                                                          .          .             .           X             X
5 - Drop standing if present, push a block to open a stair when all cleared (doors permanently stay shut, see 2nd quest level 8)            .          .             X           .             X   (2Q only)
6 - Open shutter doors if the enemy in the first slot is killed (used only for Life/Money rooms currently, as Fire is an enemy)             .          .             .           .             .
7 - Drop item hidden.  Kill all enemies to make shutters open and drop item appear.                                                         X          X             .           .             .

Thus, in shapes, 
 - Standing item implies no push-stair (unless RMOS in a no-shutter room, which uses state 5 above)
 - Shutter implies no push-stair
 - Kill->Drop implies no push-stair

within-dungeon pirouette: 
Short answer: depends on the room you up+a in. It will open any door in the start room that has been opened (not open from the start) at the time you up+a
[11:04 AM] fcoughlin: So a key door, bomb wall, or open shutter in the room you’re in will carry over to the start room of the dungeon


Enemy Groups:

I heard someone say that, of (wizzrobe, darknut, lynel, goriya), exactly 2 will be in overworld and exactly 2 in dungeons, is that true?  Any other rules of monster-bucketing I should know?  
(What was the thing with dungeons? Are there 3 different sets of dungeons monsters, and each set appears in 2 or 3 or 4 dungeons each, or something?)

jkoper: I would guess the actual group is wizzrobe, darknut, lynel, goriya, and moblin, with two of those being on the overworld and three in dungeons.  
The stalfos, gibdos, tektites, and pols voice probably fill the other slots.  I'm definitely doing a little guessing here, but it really depends on the number of sprite slots each enemy needs.

fcoughlin: There are four “groups”: overworld, the group in vanilla 1/2/7, group in vanilla 3/5/8, and group in vanilla 4/6/9.

When I shuffle groups, there will still be four groups. One is overworld, for the three dungeons, each group will be in at least two dungeons (remaining three dungeons are random, 
so in theory you could have 5 dungeons in one group).    (my math: 5/2/2 has 1/9 chance; 3/3/3 has 2/9 chance; 4/3/2 has 6/9 chance)

What enemies end in which groups comes 100% from sprite limits. There’s a fixed number of bytes per enemy group, and as a result, only some things can work together.

AdirondackRick: Now with all this being said, it’s worth notice there’s one enemy that shares two dungeon groups in each seed. In vanilla, it’s the Zols, but it could be 
gibdos, pols voices, staffols, ropes — anything that doesn’t have a red/blue pairing.  So it’s realistic for one enemy in particular to be seen in as many as seven of the nine dungeons.

Lorgon111: Semi-related: are (1Q) bubbles part of the enemy groups?  Are 'spike traps' part of the enemy groups?  Moldorm?  Is lanmola a 'boss'? 
(I presume beamos are not part of enemy groups, but part of dungeon room geometry.) 
AdirondackRick: Bubbles and spikes are not a part of an enemy group.  You can find them in any of the three. Moldorm and Lanmola are considered “bosses”, along with that dreaded rupee boss.  
The one I don’t know about is what causes lanmola to respawn after a couple room passes.
jkoper: Due to the number of sprites they use, there are only limited permutations for how boss groups can be reconstructed, and it might be kind of nice if Fred (or someone with 
sufficient knowledge of the code) took a look and laid those out. I feel like moldorm could be in any dungeon since it just uses the fireball sprite. My expectation is that the boss 
group tied to a dungeon is unrelated to the enemy group for that dungeon, but that might not be the case when they get shuffled I guess. However, we know that if bosses and boss groups 
aren't shuffled then patras can only be in 9 with Gannon and Zelda, but any monster group could be there.



Rooms that can have push blocks open shutters:

1Q rooms that can push are: Single Block, Double Block, Diamond Stair, Spiral Stair, Reverse C
2Q has: Maze, Spike Trap, Grid, Three Rows, Five Pair, Gohma, Zigzag (Turnstile aka 4-way-block obviously pushes, too, but no stair)

Thus, if 'Add 2Q rooms' is checked then almost every room with a 'block' in the middle row is a room that could have a push-block that opens 
a shutter (only exceptions: Triforce, Vertical Chute, Vertical Rows, Single 6, Double 6, rooms with a gleeok boss).
